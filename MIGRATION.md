# Migration notes

Per release tag, newest first. Read by the platform's own version surface
(`GET /platform/versions`) and served to creators' agents through `vincentt
outdated`. Accurate or absent — never speculative. `required: false` is the
authored "no action required," not silence.

## 1.6.0
required: false
No action required.
- The template now depends on harness `2.0.0`. The preview tunnel client moved into the CLI, so the app no longer installs it or its WebSocket library. Nothing in the template imported it. An upgrade carries the new pin.
- A framed app whose own address carries `source=webcam` now starts on the webcam instead of a sample video. The console gallery's Live frame uses this. A creator's preview frame never sets it, and a configured source is still never overridden.
- Release tooling only: the template's release job now runs in a tag-only environment and refuses tags that are not bare semver on main. It does nothing in a creator's project.

## 1.5.9
required: false
No action required.
- New scaffolds now start with SDK `2.0.0-alpha.8`; existing projects retain their current SDK pin until they update or reseed.
- The SDK's sample-media list now offers the hosted sample videos before the webcam, so the source list starts with a video and the webcam is still listed.
- SDK `2.0.0-alpha.8` is additive: holistic and iris tracking, reusable gestures, segmentation overlays and person cut-out, a coordinate toolkit, capability and camera permission handling, an asset cache, a tracking configuration and product placement AR. Adaptive quality is now on by default and can be turned off on the provider.
- The template grounding now states that it targets SDK `2.0.0-alpha.8`, and keeps its "(alpha.8)" markers so a project on an older pin can see which APIs need the newer SDK. The grounding file is not replaced by an upgrade, so only new scaffolds get it.

## 1.5.8
required: false
No action required.
- A brand-new scaffold's starting scene now runs face tracking only; the hand bounding box still ships but is not mounted. The scene is creator-owned, so an existing project keeps whatever trackers it already mounts.
- The page no longer loads the Poppins font from Google Fonts, because nothing in the template uses it. A project that styled its own text with Poppins now falls back to the system font unless it loads the font itself.
- The page now opens its connection to the platform CDN early, so the tracking files do not wait on connection setup when they are requested.
- Production builds now preload the entry's static script chunks. This is in the build script, which an upgrade does not replace, so only new scaffolds get it.
- The agent contract (AGENTS.md) now says `vincentt create` exits 4 with the `vincentt login` remedy in a folder that already holds an app when there is no account and no terminal, and quotes the preview ending lines without em-dashes, matching the CLI release that ships alongside. AGENTS.md is not replaced by an upgrade, so only new scaffolds get it.
- New scaffolds now start with SDK `2.0.0-alpha.7`; existing projects retain their current SDK pin until they update or reseed.

## 1.5.7
required: false
No action required.
- Release tooling only: the starter now carries two checks for the template's own release tags and its `latest` pointer. They run only in the template repository and do nothing in a creator's project.

## 1.5.6
required: false
No action required.
- The starter's default scene now demonstrates face and hand bounding boxes plus a footer HUD. These are creator-owned files, so upgrading an existing project will not add them; only a brand-new scaffold receives them.
- The starter's agent-contract docs were corrected to point at the SDK's own grounding file instead of a merge step that does not exist. Those docs are not touched by the upgrade either, so this only affects newly-scaffolded projects.

## 1.5.5
required: false
No action required.
- The local preview script now falls back automatically when the platform CLI is not resolvable on the shell's PATH, instead of only printing an install hint.
