// 4C · QA-F13-G45 — **the app freezes and releases through
// `canvasProps.frameloop`, and a media command clears the hold BEFORE applying the
// source.**
//
// ── WHAT IS AND IS NOT MOCKED, BECAUSE IT DECIDES WHAT THIS CAN PROVE ─────────
//
//   · `@vincentt-xr/harness` is **NOT** mocked. Every message below crosses the
//     REAL `openConsoleChannel`, the REAL origin check and the REAL source check.
//     A hand-written fake channel here would assert this repo's GUESS at the wire
//     shape and stay green while the two repos drifted — the f1 failure exactly.
//   · `<XRScene>` **IS** mocked, to a component that records the props it was
//     handed. `frameloop` is r3f's, consumed inside a real WebGL canvas jsdom
//     cannot run, and the assertion is about WHAT THE APP HANDS THE SDK — which is
//     the boundary `D-the-freeze-prop-is-canvasProps-not-frameloop` fixed.
//   · the SDK session **IS** faked. Applying a source is not this case's subject;
//     the ORDER it happens in relative to the release is.
//
// ── THE ORDERING IS THE ASSERTION, NOT THE END STATE ──────────────────────────
//
// A build that applies the source and THEN clears the hold reaches an IDENTICAL
// end state — released, new source — while leaving one frame painted behind a
// freeze. So the probe records what the scene was being told to do AT THE MOMENT
// the source landed, which is the only way the two are distinguishable.
//
// `D-releasing-the-hold-requires-a-synchronous-flush` is the mechanism that
// satisfies it: a plain `setPaused(false)` only QUEUES a re-render, which React
// runs after the handler returns, while the swap reaches `setMediaSource` in a
// microtask that wins the race. This case is written against the REQUIREMENT (the
// ordering), not against the mechanism, so a future implementation that satisfies
// it another way still passes.
